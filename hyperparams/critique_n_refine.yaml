# Specify one or more prompt refinement technique to be used. If you specify more than one prompt refinement techniques,
# all these technique would run on same seed data. Result, iterations needed & cost incurred for each of these
# technique would be logged. And winning technique for each data instance and overall would be logged.

# Supported prompt refinement techniques: Basic, RecursiveEval, MedPrompt
# Uncomment techniques that you want to use

The problems should take between 2 and 8 steps to solve, and solutions primarily involve performing a sequence of elementary calculations using basic arithmetic operations (+ - / *) to reach the final answer."
